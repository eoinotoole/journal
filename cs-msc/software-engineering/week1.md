# Week 1
## What is software engineering?

Software engineering is the discipline of creating professional software systems.

The term "software" can refer to many types of programs from complicated distributed applications to the embeded logic you would find in a simple household microwave. **Crucially**, the term also refers to the associated documentation, configuration and any other materials required to use the system.

Software engineering is about **all** aspects of the software creation process but is not about any specific programming skills.

## The software development lifecycle (SDLC)
The software development lifecycle is the entire process of delivering software from intial concept to release and ongoing support/maintenance. It is a systematic sequence of activities that can be applied to take project from conception to completion.

There are many different type of SDLC but all share the following activities in one form or another:
- Specification (working with stakholders to defined functionality and constraints of a system)
- Development (software is designed an implemented)
- Validation (software is tested to ensure is meets requirements)
- Evolution (software may change to meet business demands)

The following software engineering fundamentals apply to all types of software system:
- There should be a managed and understood software development process
- Dependability, performance, safety, and security are important for all types of software
- The specification of the software must be managed. Engineers should know what customers expect, and customers should be regularly updated so the project can be delivered successfully
- You should reuse existing resources whenever possible
