# Welcome to my journal!
This is a place where I come to make notes about what I'm learning, record ideas and generally ramble about my journey through the world of technology 🚀.

## Format
The idea here is to just get things down on (digital) paper as quickly and effortlessly as possible, as opposed to writing long, edited blog posts because who has the time?!

## Goals
* Create a habit of recording thoughts and learnings (I'm forgetful see)
* Become efficient at throwing thoughts down instead of endlessly staring into space thinking of the best way of wording sentences
* Create a space full of self created information I can refer back to when tackling problems
* Generate some informational output instead of the usual in in in...
* Have some fun 🐥
